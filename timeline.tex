\section{Timeline}


\begin{itemize}
\item ComCam will go on the TMA next month
	\begin{itemize}
	\item We will have images, potentially on Sky images, before year end.
	\item We will have loads of calibration data
	\end{itemize}
\item We should be able to process ComCam images at SLAC in June.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Would be nice to process all the BOT data
	\end{itemize}
\item Officially engineering first light is Jan 2023 (likely a little later)
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Then we need OGA racks etc.
	\item We will still be getting lots of engineering data from the real camera !
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The USDF timeline is in \citeds{RTN-021} the high level milestone chart is duplicated in\figref{fig:usdfplan} here.

The big question right now is {\em When can we start multi site testing with PanDA/Rucio ..
IDF, SLAC, FRdF all run PanDA \ldots}.

We need to build up tests for distributed processing RUCIO PanDA, which has started!


We need to make Jira Epics and capture decisions in technotes.

We need to agree interfaces between all the moving parts for the DFs to work with.
As always KISS!\footnote{Yes it is in the glossary.}
