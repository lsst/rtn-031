\section{Storage}

\citeds{DMTN-135} has $\approx$4PB at SLAC in 2023
BOT already consumed 500TB (a lot more than they expected).

RHL says - 4 PB seems a little thin, but probably OK if the camera slips a bit.  If we keep 3 reruns, the raw data + SFM reductions with LSSTCam will generate around 900 TB/month (5 hours a night; 30s exposures + 10s overhead).  ComCam is 25 times smaller, so no problem.

Do we need more Space for intermediaries in step wise processing  (KT 5x storage).

When do we commence backup at IN2P3 ?  OGA complicates this for commissioning
