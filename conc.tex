\section{Conclusion}

This was a great workshop.
Nice to see a DM construction product, the pipelines,  used by the USDF execution team to process data.
There were a lot of good and practical solutions arrived at for DP0.2.
Now we need to scale that up for DR1 and of course do  DP1 and 2 on the way !
