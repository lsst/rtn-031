\section{Data movement}

The main question was, It is never fast enough but how slow is Rucio?
It seems RUCIO may not be suitable for prompt processing.
Adding the OGA rack in the mix makes one wonder if Rucio belongs at all in the Chile.
There was talk of a \em{Simple} http post solution, this may not be so trivial- Steve??

Kafka over ActiveMQ for Rucio would mean one technology stack fewer at DFs - we need Kafka for the alerts.

Tuning FTS required for smaller filed 20MB.

How do we ship data back to USDF?
Intermediaries may need to be transported between DFs for different steps - extra overhead

S3 with Rucio and FT should work as of Rucio 1.24 and FTS.
Use of 3rd party copy with that - may be solved soon.

\subsection{CernVM FS}
CVFMS is used at FrDF - elsewhere ? for distribution and keeping sites in sync?
It is not really good for development, i.e. fast changing code,  but for DRP ops perhaps ?
Keeping our 3 sites all on the same pipeline version, an alternative to a docker container.

\subsection {Actions}
Need to start defining RUCIO rules .
