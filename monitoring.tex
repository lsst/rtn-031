\section{Monitoring}

Error monitoring and centralized logs are essential for debugging.
Currently at IDF Google logging is used -  is that the future also ?
Elk was mentioned for DFs.

ApachFink to trawl may be good as well.

\subsection{Interrogation of executing DRP }
How do we tell a step was successful ? QA plots ? (we don't have ..)

\subsection {Verification and Validation Team}
The answer to several questions was V\&V team:
\begin{itemize}
\item Who validates steps at UKDF/FrDF ?
\item How do we validate pilot runs across sites ?
\item Who tries to understand errors ?
\end{itemize}


\sucsection {Actions}
In any case Need to capture an collate logs and have  global visibility of them.

We will need accounts for people across all sites to investigate issues.

We Need to publicize how to rerun part of graph (just failed bit)
