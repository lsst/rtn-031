\section{Processing}

We would all like more power to process !

Some open questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item How do we assign workflows to sites (and have the right data there)
\begin{itemize}
\item What does a site need to be PanDA ready ? .. short tech note
\end{itemize}

\item Many questions at USDF
\begin{itemize}
\item CRIC and PanDA at CERN
\item Lots of other tradeoffs to be made
\end{itemize}
\item IDF and FrDF  160GB matchCatalogsTract - known will be fixed
\item Metadata between butler and Rucio is key and not worked out ..
\item Are we sure the single site model works multi site ..
\begin{itemize}
\item Is there another way ?
\item Central submission is best, right ? YES - central submission of jobs, distributed
\end{itemize}
\item Campaign management is still very manual we will need a lot of automation.
\begin{itemize}
\item This will run all the jobs at all the sites (International Execution team)
\item Not sure Jira will scale
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quanta}
Quantum graph generation taking too much memory in RSP pod for DP0.2.
We need a more robust way to do this (SQuaRE providing larger POD for now).

Quantum graph also gets slow (8 hours).
There is a issue to provide hints - could be back ported for step 3.

DP0.2 1 quantum in 315 will cause job to fail and not do the remaining quanta.
Execution team restart these jobs - FrDF need the magic for not rerunning all.

\subsection {Speed}
It needs to be faster .. DC2 is around 10 nights data  it took 4 days to do step 1.
we need to scale up a lot to do DRP in for even six months data in four months.

Merging butler 2 hours - even with Tim\'s speedups

Jim Chiang spoke of throughput issues:
\begin{itemize}
\item IO is complex/big .. but its not the entire story, something is causing a slow down ..
\item Building a container with CALIB included - for DRP may actually be a good idea.
\end{itemize}

\subsection {Agreed action }

Shared repo for BPS yaml files .. \jira{RFC-775} (Jim B)
